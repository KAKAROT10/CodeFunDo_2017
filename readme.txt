GENERAL USAGE NOTES
---------------------
Prescribe is an Aadhar based online healthcare Windows phone application which eliminates
the need for prescriptions given by doctors completely.For the service to function fully,
it is required by only the doctor to have the app installed on his/her 
Windows 8.0 smartphone or above.The app boasts of several features,including:
->two separate interfaces for doctors and patients
->a simple user registration process,which uses Aadhar Card QR scanning authentification,
thereby capturing essential user data without the need to manually enter it
->a QR scanning interface for the doctor interface,which enables the doctor to identify and 
authenticate the patient and his/her details
->an interactive prescription creation interface,which immeasurably simplifies the creation
of a prescription for the patient,complete with symptoms,diagnosis,medical tests and comments
->implementation of cloud data storage,which stores user data(both doctor and patient) 
->a patient may never even need to register if chemists also have the applications.
->a patient side prescription rating system
